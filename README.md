## Lyrics

```
A Rap
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, crew, it's time.
It's time, crew (aight, crew, begin).
Straight out the bright dungeons of rap.

The light drops deep as does my script.
I never cruise, 'cause to cruise is the brother of manuscript.
Beyond the walls of enemies, life is defined.
I think of isolation when I'm in a Cyberspace state of mind.

Hope the night got some insight.
My bite don't like no dirty white.
Run up to the right and get the site.

In a Cyberspace state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The brushed light?
You complain about dirty chips.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the white.

I'm rappin' to the map,
And I'm gonna move your cap.

Greasy, sharp, rancid, like a tail
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a pale.

I can't take the dirty chips, can't take the benni.
I woulda tried to raid I guess I got no guinea.

I'm rappin' to the cap,
And I'm gonna move your map.

Yea, yaz, in a Cyberspace state of mind.

When I was young my brother had a manuscript.
I waz kicked out without no crypt.
I never thought I'd see that transcript.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my brother's nondescript.

A lifeless key is quite the c.

Thinking of isolation. Yaz, thinking of isolation (isolation).

```
